# Chandrayaan 3 Lunar Craft: Galactic Space Craft Control (Assessment)

A command-line interface tool designed for 3D navigation of a lunar spacecraft. Users set an initial orientation and input a series of navigation commands. After execution, the application reveals the spacecraft's ending coordinates and orientation. The application is implemented using TypeScript.
